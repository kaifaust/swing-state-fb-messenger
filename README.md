# Swing State Facebook Messenger

This script simplifies sending voter participation messages to your Facebook friends who live in key swing states during elections. It automates the process of finding friends in these states and prepares a message for you to send manually.

## HOW IT WORKS
The script simulates user interactions on Facebook to identify your friends in the specified swing states. While it automates most of the steps, you'll need to click the send buttons yourself to ensure full manual control over message sending, preventing mass-messaging issues.

## DISCLOSURE
This script is designed to help you send voter participation messages to your friends in a way that maintains your manual control. It deliberately does not automate the message-sending step to avoid potential ethical concerns related to mass-messaging. Additionally, as we developed this script, we encountered no issues related to being blocked by Facebook, and we implemented mechanisms that effectively imitate human behavior to reduce the risk of automated detection. Be aware, however, that using this script may still violate Facebook's terms of service. Use at your own discretion and risk.
